# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing/storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of the story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
My intended target audience will be Aspiring Entrepreneurs like me who are looking to start their own business, particularly in the food industry. With this project, I can target audiences who are seeking to gather data insights, potential challenges, and strategies to make a successful business. Additionally, my target audience will also include current restaurant owners who are looking to improve their business models. They could benefit from the insights which this project will help them create such as top-rated cuisines, customer reviews and feedback, and analysis of their current competitors.
The public data repository gives me the flexibility to access data for all the restaurants across the states. However, for the scope of this project, I will be making a detailed analysis of the restaurants in Pittsburgh and further refining it to several zip codes in the city. Any restaurant owner or someone who is looking to build a restaurant in Pittsburgh will be my intended audience.

My approach to identifying representative individuals for my interview will be based on three types of individuals. First, someone who has strong knowledge on the restaurant industry, and who is aware of the ins and outs of the restaurant industry. Second, someone who knows the market, and the competition, but is from another industry. This will help me understand insights from the perspective of a different industry. Third, someone who is unaware of the restaurant industry, or any other specific industry, but has a strong understanding of the real-estate business. 

- 1st Individual: Male (mid-20s) with an 

- 2nd Individual: Male (mid-30s) with an Information Systems Management background, 

- 3rd Individual: Male (mid-20s) with an Information Systems Management background, who has a family business of real-estate in India, and has closely monitored and participated in real-estate investment projects.

## Interview script
To design my Interview Script, I will be using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile. This profile will consist of two broad categories and several subcategories.

- **Informative**
	- Usefulness
 	- Completeness
	- Perceptibility
	- Truthfulness
	- Intuitiveness
- **Emotive**
  	- Aesthetics
	- Engagement
- **Overall** 


| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Usefulness     |   How does the storyboard/wireframe meet the needs of its intended audience? Did you notice any specific elements that add value to the information?               |
|  Completeness    |  Are there any gaps in understanding you noticed? Does the information provided give you a full context?                |
|  Perceptibility    |   Did you find it easy to understand the information? Were there any parts in the presentation that you found hard to interpret?               |
| Truthfulness     |   Do you think the shorthand representation is accurate and valid?               |
| Intuitiveness  |    Was the representative intuitive and clear? Do you think any part requires additional explanation?              |
| Aesthetics     |   What are your thoughts on the visual appeal and the navigation of the shorthand presentation?             |
| Engagement    |   Did the storyboard/wireframe capture and hold your attention? Was it engaging or distracting?               |
| Overall   |   Are there any overall suggestions or changes you would recommend?      |
