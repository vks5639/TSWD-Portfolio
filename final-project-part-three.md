# The final data story


# Changes made since Part II
Changes identified for Part III during Part II

Based on the feedback from the user research and interviews, and also from discussion and feedback from my Professor, I have decided to make five essential changes. These changes will be implemented in my final deliverable.

1. Putting out the story of the "Intuitive Brother" in front of readers.

2. Linking the real story with the hypothetical story.

3. Find out surveys that support the reasons for Restaurant Failures.

4. Two of my users (User 1 and User 3) suggested making images bigger, deciding on intuitive colors, and adding a story between the series of visualizations that Ross, the Data Analyst created.

5. Based on the Professor's feedback "to think about what a new entrepreneur starting a restaurant would really need", I will be adding resources, and guidebooks which will help new entrepreneurs.

Additionaly, from feedback from Interview 3 and the class on 21st February that had a critique session, where I collected feedback from my peers, I added a CNBC report on strengthening the point that data-driven decision is an important aspect of deciding business success. I also cited all the images that were not already cited on Shorthand to avoid any copyright issues. I also provided references to all the sources I cited at the end of the storyboard. I also made sure that I check that there is uniformity across my portfolio, in terms of images, fonts, titles, and visualizations. Finally, I made sure that there were no grammatical errors in my work and that all the visualizations (interactive and non-interactive) were properly rendered.

## Final design decisions

Please find the detailed steps that I followed to make the above-mentioned five changes for my final decisions:

1. Visibility on Story of the "Intuitive Brother": 

2. Linking the Real story with the Hypothetical story.

3. Find out surveys that support the reasons for Restaurant Failures.

4. Two of my users (User 1 and User 3) suggested making images bigger, deciding on intuitive colors, and adding a story between the series of visualizations that Ross, the Data Analyst created.

5. Based on the Professor's feedback "to think about what a new entrepreneur starting a restaurant would really need", I will be adding resources, and guidebooks which will help new entrepreneurs.

## The audience

At the start of my project (Part I), I was primarily focused on my own journey as an aspiring real estate entrepreneur. However, after the critique session on 21st February and after the interviews, it was evident to me that there are many aspiring entrepreneurs like me who share the same story as mine. They have that big idea in their minds but are confused about where to start. Interviewing User 2, who has family-run restaurant business in Philadelphia for more than 10 years, helped me understand the pain points that a restaurant owner faces over the years. A few of the pain points discussed were deciding competitive prices, choice of location, cuisine popularity, and top competitors in the vicinity. He mentioned how making the mistake of acquiring cheaper land to set up a restaurant which was not in the heart of the city turned out to be less rewarding. User 3, who worked in other startup industries, mentioned how the concept of the 4 Ps "Product, Price, Place, and Promotion" helps decide the sustainability of the business.

For my current dataset, I have restricted the audience to aspiring real estate entrepreneurs of Pittsburgh, who want to foray into the restaurant industry. Additionally, I am working on this same project in my Capstone course at CMU. I am taking a few advanced steps where I will be widening the audience reach to the state of Pennsylvania, and then to all other states in the US. My final targeted audience will be aspiring entrepreneurs across all industries not only real estate. Data accessed from Yelp and Google My Business APIs and providing easy-to-understand Tableau Visualizations will help my audience take calculated risks and smartly approach their ventures. Finally, I will add links to public data repositories, and guidebooks that entrepreneurs can refer to for their personal research.
