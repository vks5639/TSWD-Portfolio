# Changes made since Part II
Changes identified for Part III during Part II

Based on the feedback from the user research and interviews, and also from discussion and feedback from my Professor, I have decided to make five essential changes. These changes will be implemented in my final deliverable.

1. Putting out the story of the "Intuitive Brother" in front of readers.

2. Linking the real story with the hypothetical story.

3. Find out surveys that support the reasons for Restaurant Failures.

4. Two of my users (User 1 and User 3) suggested making images bigger, deciding on intuitive colors, and adding a story between the series of visualizations that Ross, the Data Analyst created.

5. Based on the Professor's feedback "to think about what a new entrepreneur starting a restaurant would really need", I will be adding resources, and guidebooks which will help new entrepreneurs.

Additionaly, from feedback from Interview 3 and the class on 21st February that had a critique session, where I collected feedback from my peers, I added a CNBC report on strengthening the point that data-driven decision is an important aspect of deciding business success. I also cited all the images that were not already cited on Shorthand to avoid any copyright issues. I also provided references to all the sources I cited at the end of the storyboard. I also made sure that I check that there is uniformity across my portfolio, in terms of images, fonts, titles, and visualizations. Finally, I made sure that there were no grammatical errors in my work and that all the visualizations (interactive and non-interactive) were properly rendered.

## Final design decisions

Please find the detailed steps that I followed to make the above-mentioned five changes for my final decisions:

1. Visibility on Story of the "Intuitive Brother": 

2. Linking the Real story with the Hypothetical story.

3. Find out surveys that support the reasons for Restaurant Failures.

4. Two of my users (User 1 and User 3) suggested making images bigger, deciding on intuitive colors, and adding a story between the series of visualizations that Ross, the Data Analyst created.

5. Based on the Professor's feedback "to think about what a new entrepreneur starting a restaurant would really need", I will be adding resources, and guidebooks which will help new entrepreneurs.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.
